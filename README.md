In this challenge, our goal is to be able to determine and predict through neural networks which non-profit organizations are worthwhile in supporting. Ultimately, my model ended up with one neuron to attempt to determine non-profits with a positive outcome. My model was not able to achieve the 75% threshold, plateauing around 73%. Additional measures to improve model performance included adding additional hidden layers, changing activation factor, and increasing number of epochs. However, with these methods, accuracy improved only by less than half percent. If I were to implement a different model, I would try an ensembler such as sci-kit learn's RandomForestClassifier. I would like to see how the decision tree would determine worthiness of support.
